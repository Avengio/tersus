Tersus

An achingly simple WordPress theme without the usual cruft.


-----------------------------------------------------------

About

-----------------------------------------------------------

Tersus is an exercise in publishing template minimalism.

Why create yet another theme? As clean looking and stripped
down as some themes are, we honestly wanted to take things
quite a bit further.

Tersus was originally called Simplicity, a name that was
suggested prior to the discovery of a WordPress theme
already using that name. After a brief discussion, several
latin terms were bandied about as replacements. Tersus
(which means ‘clean, neat, or cleansed’) seemed to fit the
bill rather nicely ... and here we are.

Features

-----------------------------------------------------------

+ HTML5
+ Uses reset and base stylesheets for a clean start
+ No superfluous WordPress classes gumming up the works

Lovely chaps, all of them.

The groundwork for Tersus was based on the Starkers theme
created by the affable Elliot Jay Stocks.
