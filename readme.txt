Tersus

An achingly simple WordPress theme without all the usual cruft.

About

-----------------------------------------------------------

Tersus is an exercise in publishing template minimalism.

Why create yet another theme? As clean and stripped down as
some themes are, we wanted to prune things a bit further.

Tersus was originally called Simplicity, a name that was
suggested prior to the discovery of a WordPress theme
already using that name. After a brief discussion, several
latin terms were bandied about as replacements. Tersus
(which means ‘clean, neat, or cleansed’) seemed to fit the
bill rather nicely ... and here we are.

A version of Tersus is also being developed for Tumblr.
