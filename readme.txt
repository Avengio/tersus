Tersus

A simple, blank-slate WordPress theme without the usual cruft.


-----------------------------------------------------------

What is Tersus?

-----------------------------------------------------------

It’s an exercise in publishing template minimalism, based on
the nearly perfect Starkers theme by Elliot Jay Stocks, and
brought to you by Chris Harrison, Grant Hutchinson, Dan
Rubin, and Andy van der Raadt. Lovely chaps, all. Why create
yet another theme? Well, as tidy as the Starkers theme is,
we really wanted to tweak things a little bit more.

Tersus was originally called Simplicity, a name first
suggested by Dan Rubin prior to discovering that there was
already a WordPress theme with the same name. After a brief
discussion amongst the aforementioned collaborators, several
latin terms were bandied about as replacements. Tersus
(which means ‘clean, neat, or cleansed’) seemed to fit the
bill rather nicely ... and here we are.


-----------------------------------------------------------

What makes Tersus so damn special?

Coming soon.
