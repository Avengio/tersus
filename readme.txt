Tersus

An achingly simple WordPress theme without the usual cruft.

About

-----------------------------------------------------------

Tersus is an exercise in publishing template minimalism.

Why create yet another theme? Well, as nearly close to
perfect as Elliot Jay Stocks' Starkers theme is, we really
wanted to tweak things a bit further.

Tersus was originally called Simplicity, a name that was
suggested prior to the discovery of a WordPress theme
already using that name. After a brief discussion, several
latin terms were bandied about as replacements. Tersus
(which means ‘clean, neat, or cleansed’) seemed to fit the
bill rather nicely ... and here we are.
