OK - So I had to start over with the repo in github. This allowed me to get getting updates from the tersus theme while I dev the site in an experimental branch
Figured out how to add a main nav to the header as well as show certain pages on the home page.
Dumped all the raw content into the same pages as currently exists on calgaryaikikai.com 
Added the OOCSS grids module to the style sheet import stack
GOing to bed now

NEXT STEPS:
Layout the home page to using the grids templates
Merge the two sidebars into one
