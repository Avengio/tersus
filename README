Tersus*

A simple, blank-slate WordPress theme without the usual cruft.

This exercise in publishing template minimalism is brought
to you by Chris Harrison, Grant Hutchinson, Dan Rubin, and
Andy van der Raadt. Lovely chaps, all. Tersus is based on
the nearly perfect ‘Starkers’ theme by the indubitable Elliot
Jay Stocks. We just wanted to tweaks things a bit further.

The ‘Tersus’ theme is absolutely free and conveniently
licensed under GPL. You may use it for personal or
commercial projects, as you see fit.

(* The name of this theme was originally 'Simplicity'. It was first
suggested by Dan Rubin prior to realizing that there was
already a WordPress theme with the same name. Therefore, the
actual name of this project is yet to be determined.)
