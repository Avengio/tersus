Tersus*

A simple, blank-slate WordPress theme without the usual cruft.

This exercise in publishing template minimalism is brought
to you by Chris Harrison, Grant Hutchinson, Dan Rubin, and
Andy van der Raadt. Lovely chaps, all. Tersus is based on the
nearly perfect ‘Starkers’ theme by the indubitable Elliot Jay
Stocks. We just wanted to tweak things a little bit more.

The ‘Tersus’ theme is absolutely free and conveniently
licensed under GPL. You may use it for personal or commercial
projects, as you see fit.

* This theme was originally going to be called ‘Simplicity’.
The name was first suggested by Dan Rubin prior to realizing
that there was already a WordPress theme with the same name.
After a brief discussion amongst the collaborators, several
latin terms were bandied about as replacements. Tersus (which
means ‘clean, neat, or cleansed’) seemed to fit the bill
rather nicely … and here we are.
